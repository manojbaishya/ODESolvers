## TODO

1. Redesign CashKarpRKF45 to output variable stepsize data directly instead of predefined gaps.
2. Implement Events to detect critical points in solution.
3. Debug existing CashKarpRKF45 for DPP (GNC Assignment 2 Problem 1).
4. Document solution process (user friendly).
5. Build aircraft models for test cases. Create solutions with graphical illustrations.
